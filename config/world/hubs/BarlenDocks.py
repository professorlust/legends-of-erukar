Barlen, so named for the vast barley crops which span miles and miles past the city, relies heavily on port traffic on both the rivers Iuria and Farrago. The docks routinely handle passenger and goods transport to and from Lu√Ønden throughout the year and experience a massive uptick in traffic during harvest."
