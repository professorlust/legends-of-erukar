class ModifierWord(SpellWord):
    '''
    A Modifier word consumes a small amount of arcane energy and modifies the remainder of 
    what is available in some way. Modifier words are typically used by mages who have 
    acquired a modest spellbook. An example of a Modifier Word is Fire, which modifies the
    arcane energy to possess the fire element.
