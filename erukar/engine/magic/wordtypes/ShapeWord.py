class ShapeWord(SpellWord):
    '''
    A Shape word shapes the conversion effect at the end of a spell word chain. These are
    technically modifier words with the specialized focus of modifying Conversion Words.
    An example of a Shape word is Circular, which allows the displacement of damaging
    arcane energy over a specific radius. Another example is Persistent, which is unique
    in that it can be combined with other Shape words to provide a semi-lasting effect.
