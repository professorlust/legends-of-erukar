class SouceWord(SpellWord):
    '''
    A source word builds up arcane energy which can be converted an modified. Source words
    are always necessary for a spell to be successful. An example of this is ArcaneSource,
    the default source word for most mages. An alternative example is BloodSource, which
    consumes the caster's health to provide a reasonable boost of arcane energy. Further,
    SoulSource uses the literal essence of life to fuel arcane energy. 

    Much legislation is passed around the usage of specific Source words. In civilized
    places, BloodSource and especially SoulSource are banned and labeled heresy.
