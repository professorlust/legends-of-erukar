class Bind(SpellEffect):
    pass
'''
Binds a new soul from the Realm of the Dead to an existing corpse. The corpse must have 
no soul currently bound to it, and therefore this spell works efficaciously with Consume
This is INCREDIBLY expensive, and is effectively balanced around combined usage of Consume.
