class Zealotry:
    '''
    Zealotry improves damage dealt by a character against all enemies of a same type which do not
    operate under the same entity (e.g. Divine vs Divine with differing sources). Can be divine
    or demonic.

    Example: A player whose deity is Reia (divine) would gain bonuses against targets who follow
    other Divine deities, but not targets who follow demons or those who follow Reia.
