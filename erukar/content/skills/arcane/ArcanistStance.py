class ArcanistStance:
    '''
    A stance which indicates that a player is actively thinking about spell words to use at the
    moment. While their thoughts are consumed by the arcana they receive improvements to arcane
    efficiency and each spell counts more towards practicing, but they receive penalties to 
    evasion and sense rolls.
